# Configuration file of FAR training experiment using Aggregator & Executor containers and k8s for container deployment
### Refer to $FEDSCALE_HOME/docker/README.md for k8s deployment tutorial

# ========== Container configuration ========== 
### k8s-specific: whether to use k8s deployment
use_container: k8s

### docker & k8s: containers need a data-path mount to facilitate dataset reuse
# We assume the same data-path is used on all host machines
data_path: $FEDSCALE_HOME/benchmark

# ========== Cluster configuration ========== 
### k8s-specific: number of aggregators, right now we only support a single aggregator
# placeholder for supporting hierarchical aggregator in the future
num_aggregators: 1

### k8s-specific: number of executors
num_executors: 2


auth:
    ssh_user: ""
    ssh_private_key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# cmd to run before we can indeed run FAR (in order)

# ========== Additional job configuration ========== 
# Default parameters are specified in config_parser.py, wherein more description of the parameter can be found

# We use fixed paths in job_conf as they will be accessed inside containers
job_conf: 
    - job_name: femnist_k8s                   # Generate logs under this folder: log_path/job_name/time_stamp
    - log_path: /FedScale/benchmark # Path of log files
    - num_participants: 5                  # Number of participants per round, we use K=100 in our paper, large K will be much slower
    - data_set: femnist                     # Dataset: openImg, google_speech, stackoverflow
    - data_dir: /FedScale/benchmark/dataset/data/femnist    # Path of the dataset
    - data_map_file: /FedScale/benchmark/dataset/data/femnist/client_data_mapping/train.csv              # Allocation of data to each client, turn to iid setting if not provided
    - device_conf_file: /FedScale/benchmark/dataset/data/device_info/client_device_capacity     # Path of the client trace
    - device_avail_file: /FedScale/benchmark/dataset/data/device_info/client_behave_trace
    - model: resnet18             # NOTE: Please refer to our model zoo README and use models for these small image (e.g., 32x32x3) inputs
#    - model_zoo: fedscale-torch-zoo
    - eval_interval: 10                     # How many rounds to run a testing on the testing set
    - rounds: 21                          # Number of rounds to run this training. We use 1000 in our paper, while it may converge w/ ~400 rounds
    - filter_less: 21                       # Remove clients w/ less than 21 samples
    - num_loaders: 2
    - local_steps: 5
    - learning_rate: 0.05
    - batch_size: 20
    - test_bsz: 20
    - use_cuda: False
