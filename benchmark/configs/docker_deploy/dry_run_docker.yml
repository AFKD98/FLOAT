# Configuration file of dry run experiment using Aggregator & Executor containers and docker for container deployment
### Refer to $FEDSCALE_HOME/docker/README.md for docker deployment tutorial

# ========== Container configuration ========== 
### docker-specific: whether to use docker deployment
use_container: docker

### docker-specific: docker containers need port-mapping to communicate with host machine
# E.g., 1 aggregator and 2 executor, ports: [Aggr, Exec1, Exec2]
# Note for this example, we can use port 20011 on both Exec1 and Exec2 because they locate on different host machines
ports: [20010, 20011, 20011]

### docker-specific: docker containers need a Docker network to communicate with each other
# Create a network by: docker network create --driver=overlay --attachable fedscale-net
container_network: fedscale-net

### docker & k8s: containers need a data-path mount to facilitate dataset reuse
# We assume the same data-path is used on all host machines
data_path: $FEDSCALE_HOME/benchmark

# ========== Cluster configuration ========== 
# ip address of the parameter server (need 1 GPU process)
ps_ip: 10.0.0.1

# ip address of each worker:# of available gpus process on each gpu in this node
# Note that if we collocate ps and worker on same GPU, then we need to decrease this number of available processes on that GPU by 1
# E.g., master node has 4 available processes, then 1 for the ps, and worker should be set to: worker:3
worker_ips: 
    - 10.0.0.1:[1] # worker_ip: [(# processes on gpu) for gpu in available_gpus] eg. 10.0.0.2:[4,4,4,4] This node has 4 gpus, each gpu has 4 processes. 
    - 10.0.0.2:[1]

# ========== Additional job configuration ========== 
# Default parameters are specified in config_parser.py, wherein more description of the parameter can be found

# We use fixed paths in job_conf as they will be accessed inside containers
job_conf: 
    - job_name: dryrun_docker                   # Generate logs under this folder: log_path/job_name/time_stamp
    - log_path: /FedScale/benchmark # Path of log files
    - num_participants: 4                      # Number of participants per round, we use K=100 in our paper, large K will be much slower
    - data_set: cifar10                     # Dataset: openImg, google_speech, stackoverflow
    - data_dir: /FedScale/benchmark/dataset/data/    # Path of the dataset
    - model: resnet18                            # Models: e.g., shufflenet_v2_x2_0, mobilenet_v2, resnet34, albert-base-v2# - gradient_policy: yogi                 # {"fed-yogi", "fed-prox", "fed-avg"}, "fed-avg" by default
    - eval_interval: 10                     # How many rounds to run a testing on the testing set
    - rounds: 20                       # Number of rounds to run this training. We use 1000 in our paper, while it may converge w/ ~400 rounds
    - filter_less: 0                       # Remove clients w/ less than 21 samples
